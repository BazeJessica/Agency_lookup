That makes sense since you're building a broad agency lookup tool! You might need to combine multiple APIs or sources to cover everything. Here's a strategy to get started:  

### **1. Business & Marketing Agencies**  
- **Google Places API** (ðŸ”— [Google Maps Platform](https://developers.google.com/maps))  
- **Yelp Fusion API** (ðŸ”— [Yelp Developers](https://www.yelp.com/developers))  

### **2. Government Agencies**  
- **U.S. Data.gov API** (ðŸ”— [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov)) â€“ Has various datasets  
- **European Data Portal** (ðŸ”— [EU Open Data](https://data.europa.eu))  

### **3. Company & Industry Info**  
- **Crunchbase API** (ðŸ”— [Crunchbase Developers](https://data.crunchbase.com/)) â€“ Business insights (premium)  
- **Clearbit API** (ðŸ”— [Clearbit](https://clearbit.com)) â€“ Company data & logo info  

### **4. Web Scraping (if APIs are limited)**  
- **SerpAPI** (ðŸ”— [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/)) â€“ Scrapes Google results legally  
- **Custom Scraping with Python (BeautifulSoup/Scrapy)**  

Would you like help integrating any of these, or do you need an API that covers something specific?
